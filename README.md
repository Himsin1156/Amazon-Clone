# Amazon-Clone-Trial-For-Education-and-Practice:


<h2>Project Intent</h2>
This project is a self-made clone of Amazon.com built for educational and knowledge enhancement purposes. It is not intended for any commercial use but solely as a showcase of my front-end and back-end development skills.

<h2>Why I Created This Project</h2>
To deepen my understanding of web development concepts including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and API integration (or any technologies you used).

To practice creating scalable UI components and replicate real-world e-commerce functionalities like product listing, cart management, and user authentication.

To demonstrate my skills to potential employers and contribute to my portfolio.

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>h2>
UI/UX Replication: Recreate Amazon's clean and responsive interface using modern front-end tools.

Functionality Development: Implement core features such as product pages, shopping cart, and checkout flow.

State Management & API Handling: Gain hands-on experience in state management (e.g., Redux/Context) and handling data dynamically.

Version Control: Improve my Git and GitHub workflow, including branching, commits, and documentation.

<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
This project is strictly for educational purposes and does not aim to replicate Amazonâ€™s original proprietary code or design beyond what is necessary for learning. All images and product data are either dummy data or used for demonstration purposes only.
